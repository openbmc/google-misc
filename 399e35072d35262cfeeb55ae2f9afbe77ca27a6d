      "message": "It would be better to just drop this requirement of having a file at all. Just have the specific behavior occur when the daemon gets an `ENOENT` to say there is no update happening.\n\nYou probably do want to distinguish \"ONGOING\" from \"NO_UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS\" or whatever name. I guess just the descriptive string is good enough, but it might be nice for automation to have different codes for those.",

It guarantees the file contents get updated atomically by writing to a tempfile and leveraging `rename`.\n\nYou also wouldn\u0027t need to differentiate updating and creating a new file.",
