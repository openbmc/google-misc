      "message": "We\u0027ve said a long time ago we were not going to be putting new daemons into google-misc.  Google-misc was intended as a *TEMPORARY* location for Google to be able to expose some daemons they had written in house in the hopes that you would eventually figure out how to upstream them.  I\u0027m whole-heartedly opposed to google-misc being used as a sandbox for developing new daemons at this point.\n\nPlease request a new repository be created for this, or find an existing repository it belongs into.",
