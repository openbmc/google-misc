      "message": "Looks like the whole purpose of this separate usage is to log this formatted message into the syslog? If that is the case then I suggest:\n1. in the gbmc-br-dhcp script have a function, take \"State\" \"Time\" \"Message\" \"Code\" \"Retries\" as input, output is a string e.g. \"formatted_log_msg\"\n2. Just call \"update-dhcp-status \u0027ONGOING\u0027 formatted_log_msg\", and output it into syslog just with echo.\n\nThis way we don\u0027t have to change this file at all, avoiding having two weird usage, and also we can avoid a different syslog entry name \"gbmc_netboot\" other than \"udhcpc6\", easy for us to corelated with the original log/error message in the process.\n\nLet me know if this simplify things a bit.",

      "message": "We could do that, reason I wanted to do that is because I intentionally wanted structured messages to appear as `gbmc_netboot` so we can easily filter it for later on analysis on cloud, if it doesn\u0027t have a tag and just tied with \"udhcpc6\" we\u0027ll have to figure out some sort of filtering and will slow down database analysis on scale. What do you think?\n\nMy only concern about adding filtering mechanism on backend instead of here where clear tag enables us to extract messages is scalability.",
